I"˜<p>Many growers underestimate this Sarracenia species, classifying it as boring. But S. alata creates SPECTACULAR fall pitchers, when the other species are already going into dormancy, and it encompasses the darkest Sarracenias, those of the variety Sarracenia alata var. nigropurpurea. These are particularly well suited in crosses to create dark color variants. If you want BLACK plants, go for these.</p>
