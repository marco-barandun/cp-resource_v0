Many growers underestimate this Sarracenia species, classifying it as boring. But S. alata creates SPECTACULAR fall pitchers, when the other species are already going into dormancy, and it encompasses the darkest Sarracenias, those of the variety Sarracenia alata var. nigropurpurea. These are particularly well suited in crosses to create dark color variants. If you want BLACK plants, go for these.

## Etymology
Etymologically, the species name indicates that the pitchers of this species have a structure called "ala", that is, the flat vertical flange on the front of the pitcher. However, this is not a peculiarity of this species, since all Sarracenia species have an ala and in fact this name is confusing, at least for me. It can be identified by its ovate hoods, by the necks of the pitchers not being constricted and by the almost complete lack of phyllodia.

## Biogeography
The biogeography of this species is interesting, in fact the species is present in two distinct geographic ranges, one being roughly eastern Texas and western Louisiana while the second encompasses eastern Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama. The western group is isolated from other Sarracenia species and hybrids with other species can be excluded, i.e. those populations can be considered pure bred S. alata.
